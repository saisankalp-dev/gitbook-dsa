# Welcome

This book aims to establish the basic principles and patterns required to learn and get better at Data Structures and Algorithms.

> **Note:** \
> The names added for some of the patterns here are based on how I have them visualised in my head. They help get an idea about the patterns quickly. Do not use in interviews.
